This repository contains a collection of reinforcement learning environments and agents developed for training and testing simple navigation behaviors.

## Projects

### MoveToGoal

In **MoveToGoal**, the agent is tasked with reaching a reward point in the shortest possible time while avoiding any contact with the environmentâ€™s borders. The project focuses on optimizing pathfinding behavior under spatial constraints.

**Reward Mechanics**
* Positive Reward:
  * +5: For successfully reaching the target.
* Negative Reward (Penalties):
  * -0.0001: A small penalty applied at each step to encourage faster completion.
  * -0.01: For colliding with a wall (border).

### SphereHunt
In **SphereHunt**, the agent's objective is to first locate a button and then perform a specific _discrete action_ to press it. Once activated, the goal appears, and the agent must then collect it as quickly as possible. This project emphasizes sequential task completion and efficient navigation within a dynamic environment.

**Reward Mechanics**
* Positive Reward:
  * +2: For successfully pressing the button.
  * +10: For collecting the spawned goal.
* Negative Reward (Penalties):
  * -0.0001: A small penalty applied at each step to encourage faster completion.
  * -0.01: For colliding with a wall (border).
