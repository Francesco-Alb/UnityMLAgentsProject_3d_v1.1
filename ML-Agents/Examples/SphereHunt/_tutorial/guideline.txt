Guideline for Setup
1.	Create Environment:
o	Build a Unity environment with a plane as the ground.
o	Add walls to limit the playable area.
2.	Add GameObjects:
o	Agent: Add a GameObject with an Agent component. Attach the Agent script.
o	Target: Add a sphere GameObject with a Rigidbody and the TargetLogic script.
3.	Setup Tags:
o	Tag the target as Target.
o	Tag the walls as Wall.
4.	Assign Materials:
o	Create materials for win, lose, pressed button, and unpressed button states. Assign them in the Inspector.
5.	Link Components:
o	In the MoveToGoalAgent script, assign the references for the button and target.
o	In the ButtonLogic and TargetLogic, set parameters like materials, spawn areas, etc.
Attach the ButtonLogic script to the ButtonBase GameObject.
Drag the child Button object into the buttonMeshRenderer field in the Inspector.
6.	Train the Agent:
o	Set up the ML-Agents Toolkit and define an action space (2 continuous actions for movement and 1 discrete action for pressing the button).
o	Train the agent using the Unity ML-Agents trainer.
